    <h3>We never want to fit into one box. What Deadlands dreams of is to evolve with the audience that supports them and grows with them. While we always want to stem from distorted voices and intensity, we write what comes to us and what feels natural. The eclectic sound is what finds our music suitable for everyone.</h3>
